1. Download the archive and extract it into /usr/local,
  creating a Go tree in /usr/local/go. For example:

tar -C /usr/local -xzf go$VERSION.$OS-$ARCH.tar.gz
                       go1.2.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz

(Typically these commands must be run as root or through sudo.)

Add /usr/local/go/bin to the PATH environment variable.
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin

You can do this by adding this line to your /etc/profile (for a system-wide installation) or $HOME/.profile:

The Go binary distributions assume they will be installed in /usr/local/go


2. https://www.jetbrains.com/help/go/installing-and-launching-goland.html

tar xfz goland-2017.3.tar.gz <new_archive_folder>

The recommended installation location is /opt. To install GoLand into this directory, enter the following command:

sudo tar xfz goland-2017.3.tar.gz -C /opt/

A new instance must not be extracted over the existing one. The target folder must be empty.

For example,
cd /opt/goland-2017.3/bin
./goland.sh

in desktop,  create a New Launcher here...   where in the command set:

/opt/GoLand-2017.3.2/bin/./goland.sh
