Your account [m******.b****@gmail.com] doesn’t have a proper role like “the compute Instance Admin role” [1].
If you would like to connect the instance with your account, I suggest to add “the compute Instance Admin role”
to the account [m******.b****@gmail.com]. 

Meanwhile, you can check ssh as well following recommendations below and actions in order to identify the
root cause of this unwanted behavior.

1. Make sure that the account has authenticated to gcloud as an IAM user with the compute instance admin role as
I explained above.   For example, run commands below on the Cloud Shell[2].

gcloud auth revoke --all 
gcloud auth login
gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-central1-f” "liberdina-virtualbank” --ssh-flag=-vvv

2. Verify that persistent SSH Keys metadata for gcloud is set for either the project or instance.
   Sometimes Metadata SSH Keys may expire. Consult this document [3] to learn how to handle SSH key metadata
   on GCP. And try ssh again.  

gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-central1-f” "liberdina-virtualbank” --ssh-flag=-vvv

3. Force gcloud to recreate the user's SSH key pair then try gcloud compute ssh again.
   Move the existing key pair aside using these commands:
   mv ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine ~/.ssh/old-google_compute_engine
   mv ~/.ssh/google_compute_engine.pub ~/.ssh/old-google_compute_engine.pub
And try ssh again.   

gcloud compute ssh --zone "us-central1-f” "liberdina-virtualbank” --ssh-flag=-vvv


gcloud compute ssh liberdina-virtualbank --zone us-central1-f --ssh-flag=-vvv


4. Try to connect using another username as is described in document [4].

Let me know the results once done and I am looking forward to it.

In case you have additional questions, please feel free to reply to this message and I will gladly assist you.

Kind regards,
